# Minimal Jeckyll Template

This is a minimal setup of a jekyll static site blog 
using some liquid syntax, markdown and css. No javascript.

It's main purpose is to be used as a DIY baseline blog 
structure from which to customise.

I can think of ways to improve it with keyword metadata 
or even json-ld

The blog is here:
